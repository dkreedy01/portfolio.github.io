						<h2>Who I Am: A Personal Note</h2>
						<p>Writing is one of many things that preoccupies my mind and time. As the daughter of two teachers, I learned just how important education is. I inherited a deep appreciation of history from my father and a fascination for disability studies from my mother, who worked as a special education teacher for over thirty years. My passion for learning doesn't stop with my parents' interests; I am also fascinated by environmental science, medical studies, and psychology. My academic pursuits have made their way into my writing, inspiring stories in my mind and on paper.</p>
						<p>I have a portfolio of story ideas saved for a rainy day, and now that I have time to myself, I am looking forward to working. My imagination is my best asset, providing me with a creative savvy that helps me think through challenges in an abstract way. I have always come up with a way to achieve what I need in a way that no one else has, but it isn't just my creativity that has provided what I need to succeed. My staunch determination has seen me through life, regardless of any roadblocks that might otherwise have halted me. Although some might view my drive as stubbornness, it has given me the courage to keep moving forward despite everything in my way.</p>
						<p>I'm a recent graduate with a fierce need to begin working. I continue to write daily, just as I was taught, but I will require more practice to excel as a writer. I am passionate about the craft and can adapt to any genre or tone. I am not picky when it comes to writing, and I can always find a way to spin a story, edit a piece, or assist in publishing an author's dream work. I can achieve anything when I set my mind to it, and I am confident that I can help others do the same by utilizing what I know best. Give me a chance, and you'll see me fly.</p>
